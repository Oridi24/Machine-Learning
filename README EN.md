# *Machine Learning*

*Machine Learning (ML) is a field of Artificial Intelligence that enables machines to learn from data and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. Through mathematical algorithms and computational statistics, ML allows us to build models capable of making predictions or uncovering hidden patterns in large volumes of information.*

## *Project Objectives*

*This project aims to develop a Machine Learning model by systematically and comprehensively applying various data science and supervised learning techniques to a regression problem to predict the price of property listings on Airbnb.*

***Throughout the process, we focus on:***

- *Exploratory Data Analysis, using preprocessing techniques, cleaning, and handling of missing values.*
- *Outlier detection and treatment using methods like Z-Score, percentiles, and visualizations such as *scatterplots* and *histograms*.*
- *Correlation analysis using heatmaps.*
- *Scaling and transformation of numerical variables (e.g., `StandardScaler`, `Log Transform`).*
- *Encoding of categorical variables using `OrdinalEncoder` and `LabelEncoder`.*
- *Application of Machine Learning Algorithms:*
  - **Linear models** such as: `Ridge`, `Lasso`
  - **Tree-based models** such as: `DecisionTreeRegressor`, `HistGradientBoostingRegressor`
- *Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning with `GridSearchCV`.*
- *Interpretation of metrics such as **MSE** (Mean Squared Error) and **R²** (Coefficient of Determination).*
- *Adherence to Best Practices*, such as:
  - *Clear separation of training and testing sets before model fitting.*
  - *Code modularization and in-line comments to facilitate understanding.*

## *Technologies and Libraries Used*

- Python, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`

## *Prerequisites*
